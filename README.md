# crfa-offchain-data-registry

This registry contains mappings of script hashes to dApps. Please add your project here or correct mistakes. We are maintaining it on best effort basis.


Caveats:
In the eUTXO model smart contracts are not deployed
to an address so there is nothing that forces smart contracts
to use a single script hash.
Nothing stops a project from having a script hash that changes over time by inlining data into the script
